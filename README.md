# Hi, I'm Isaac Ramalho (a.k.a. aCosmicDebugger)

## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac Ramalho, also known as **aCosmicDebugger**. With a PhD in Physics specializing in cosmological data analysis, I bridge the gap between exploring the mysteries of the universe and solving complex data challenges. I'm passionate about leveraging statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning to extract insights from data and drive impactful solutions.

Currently, I work as a Mid-level Data Scientist at Biofy, where I develop deep learning models for asset forecasting and craft LLM-based solutions tailored for the legal and agribusiness sectors. My professional journey also includes projects for a leading logistics company, where I built machine learning models to optimize transportation processes and boost operational efficiency. I manage all stages of the project lifecycleâ€”from data collection and pipeline design to deploymentâ€”using modern tools like Docker and FastAPI. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I focus on turning raw data into actionable insights that enhance decision-making.
