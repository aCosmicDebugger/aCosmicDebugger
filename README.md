Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Isaac Ramalho, but you can call me **aCosmicDebugger**.
I'm passionate about exploring the cosmos, software development and 
diving deep into the universe of debugging.

## Interests

- Data analysis & Data analytics
- Exploring the vastness of programming languages
- Cosmic coding adventures


## Tech Stack &  Skills

Here are some of the technologies and/or languages I love to work with:

- Python  (mostly for data analysis but now learning how to use it for backend development)

- JavaScript (learning a bit for web-dev too)

- Monte Carlo Simulation

- Gaussian Processes

- Machine Learning (_supervised_ for now, hope to get into _unsupervised_)
